Here's a step-by-step explanation of how your Node.js Media Management API code works:

### 1. **Project Structure**
   - **index.js**: The main entry point of the application where the server is created and routes are defined.
   - **routes/mediaRoutes.js**: Contains route definitions for handling media-related requests.
   - **controllers/mediaController.js**: Contains the logic for handling requests and interacting with the data model.
   - **models/mediaModel.js**: Contains database interaction logic to perform CRUD operations.
   - **config/db.js**: Manages the connection to the MySQL database.

### 2. **Starting the Server (index.js)**
   - **Setup**: The application starts by requiring necessary modules, including Express and the routes file.
   - **Middleware**: `app.use(express.json())` is called to parse incoming JSON requests, allowing the server to handle JSON data.
   - **Routing**: The API routes are prefixed with `/api` and managed by the `mediaRoutes` file.
   - **Server Listening**: Finally, `app.listen(PORT, () => {...})` starts the server, listening on the specified port (defaulting to 3000 if not defined).

### 3. **Defining Routes (routes/mediaRoutes.js)**
   - The routes are set up using Express Router:
     - **POST /api/media**: Calls `createMedia` to create a new media entry.
     - **GET /api/media/:mobile_number**: Calls `getMediaByMobileNumber` to retrieve media by mobile number.
     - **PUT /api/media/:mobile_number**: Calls `updateMediaByMobileNumber` to update a media entry.
     - **DELETE /api/media/:media_id**: Calls `deleteMediaByMediaId` to delete a media entry.

### 4. **Handling Requests (controllers/mediaController.js)**
   - Each route corresponds to a controller function:
     - **createMedia**: Extracts data from the request body and calls the `create` method from the model to insert a new record into the database.
     - **getMediaByMobileNumber**: Uses the mobile number from the route parameters to query the database for a specific media entry.
     - **updateMediaByMobileNumber**: Updates the media record by calling the `updateByMobileNumber` method from the model with the provided data.
     - **deleteMediaByMediaId**: Deletes a media record based on the media ID passed in the request.

### 5. **Database Interaction (models/mediaModel.js)**
   - The model defines methods to interact with the MySQL database:
     - **create**: Inserts a new media entry using an SQL `INSERT` query.
     - **findByMobileNumber**: Fetches media entries by mobile number using an SQL `SELECT` query.
     - **updateByMobileNumber**: Updates an existing media entry using an SQL `UPDATE` query.
     - **deleteByMediaId**: Deletes a media entry based on the media ID using an SQL `DELETE` query.

### 6. **Database Configuration (config/db.js)**
   - This file manages the connection to the MySQL database using the `mysql2` package, ensuring that queries can be executed against the database.

### Summary of Workflow:
1. The client sends an HTTP request to one of the defined routes (e.g., creating a media entry).
2. The request is handled by the corresponding controller function.
3. The controller interacts with the model to perform the necessary database operations.
4. The model executes SQL queries and returns the results to the controller.
5. The controller sends the appropriate HTTP response back to the client.
